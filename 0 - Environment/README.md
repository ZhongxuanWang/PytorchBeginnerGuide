## Installation
* **The first thing we do**, is to install the pytorch environment. 
  * If you haven't installed pip or conda, you can install them first
  * Then, refer to the official document: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. We often make mistakes if we don't refer to them.
* **Then**, we type: ```python3``` into the terminal, and then ```import torch as t``` to test installation
